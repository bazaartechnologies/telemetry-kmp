## Getting Started

### 1. Add Dependency

> **Coming soon:** Published artefacts for MavenCentral and CocoaPods/SwiftPM.

For now, build and publish locally:

```bash
./gradlew :telemetry-kmp:publishToMavenLocal
```

### 2. Initialize Telemetry

```kotlin
import com.bazaar.telemetry.*

Telemetry.init(
    DefaultTelemetryConfig(
        serviceName = "MyApp",
        endpoint = "https://otel.example.com"
    )
)
```

### 3. Usage Examples

#### Logging
```kotlin
Telemetry.log(LogLevel.INFO, "User logged in", attrs = Attributes.builder().put("user.id", "123").build())
```

#### Tracing
```kotlin
Telemetry.span("login") { span ->
    span.setAttribute("screen", "Login")
    // ...
}
```

#### Metrics
```kotlin
Telemetry.counter("api.requests", 1, attrs = Attributes.builder().put("endpoint", "/login").build())
Telemetry.gauge("battery.level", 87.0)
```
